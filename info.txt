setting up the server:

1 - Download redis (for windows or linux, whichever you use)
2 & 3 client - Open intelliJ Idea and search for the client folder, after
  that rebuild the client (before that, check the ips.)
2 & 3 server - Open the server solution (.sln file) with visual studio 15+
  Rebuild the solution (before that, check the ips.)
4 - Copy the "resources" folder to the bin folder (server/bin)
5 - Open the "redis-server.exe" as admin
6 - Open "server.exe" and "wserver.exe" as admin
7 - Open the client. Done.

EXTRA: in order to get yourself a rank, do the following:

open "redis-cli.exe" (when you already have "redis-server.exe"
open as admin);

hget NAMES AYAYA (put your account name instead of "AYAYA")
hset account.ID ranks 110 (ID = THE ID OF YOUR ACCOUNT, that you just got from
the previous thing; ranks = rank or ranks I do not remember)
hset account.ID admin 1
